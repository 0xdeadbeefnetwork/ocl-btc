ðŸ”’ What the Code Does:

OpenCL Kernel for Random Data Generation:

GPU Memory Access: We use an OpenCL kernel to read dynamic data from the GPU. The kernel accesses memory locations and performs multiple rounds of calculations to generate pseudo-random data.
Repetition for Security: To ensure robust randomness, we perform 8192 rounds of data processing. This extensive computation helps in creating a more unpredictable and secure random seed.
Random Data Combination:

Additional Entropy Sources: We gather additional entropy from various sources:
OS Random Data: Utilizes the operating system's built-in randomness.
Current Time: Includes the current Unix epoch time for added unpredictability.
System Data: Collects dynamic system information to further increase randomness.
Hashing for Uniformity: The combined entropy data is hashed using SHA-256 to produce a secure and uniform random private key.
Bitcoin Wallet Generation:

Private Key Generation: Converts the hashed entropy into a private key, which is then formatted into Wallet Import Format (WIF) for easier use.
Public Key and Address Creation: Using ECDSA, the private key generates a corresponding public key. This public key is then hashed and encoded to produce a Bitcoin address.
User Interaction:

Number of Wallets: The script allows the user to specify how many wallets to generate, making it versatile for different needs.
Clean Output: We suppress unnecessary warnings and provide a clean output of the generated private keys, public keys, and Bitcoin addresses.
ðŸ”§ Code Highlights:

OpenCL Kernel Code: Efficiently handles random data generation on the GPU.
Python Integration: Combines GPU randomness with cryptographic operations using Python.
Security Focus: Ensures the highest level of randomness and security for wallet generation.
